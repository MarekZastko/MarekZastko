- 💡 I thrive where leadership, problem-solving, and precision meet. Whether it’s organizing complex processes, motivating people, or optimizing systems, I bring structure, energy, and a results-driven mindset to everything I do

- 📈 What does that look like in practice?

- Enterprising 🚀 I love leading, influencing, and driving change. If something can be done better, I’ll make sure it happens

- Social 🤝 Problem-solving isn’t just about numbers; it’s about people. I enjoy helping others, coaching teams, and making collaboration seamless

- Conventional 📊 I have a knack for structure, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making. Order in chaos? That’s my playground

- ✨ Multipotential at heart. I don’t fit neatly into a single box-because why would I? My skills span across tech, business, strategy, and communication, allowing me to connect the dots in ways others might not see

- ⚡ Proactive? Always. If there’s something that can be optimized, automated, or made 10x better, I’ll find it and make sure it happens
